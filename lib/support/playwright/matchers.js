       * Unfortunately, the Playwright API, unlike Selenium WebDriver API, does not provide
       * such functionality:'(.
       * The `toPass` option has not shown any simillar issues during our experiments.
       * So it is used below. Yet being not ideal, because leads to "double-logging" of its step
       * in the report.
       * There is a third option in playwright "to wait", it's `waitForFunction`,
       * // TODO: but we are not sure we can use `waitForFunction` with locator as 2nd arg,
       *          so it can be `resolved` on the client side, and so retried if failed.
